# Modern MJML theme

This theme was used to generate the modern theme and export it as a twig theme using a custom Symfony
command. You can use it as a base if you want to create a MJML based template but you will have to convert
it to a twig template (which are managed by core).

```
./bin/console prestashop:mail:convert-mjml modern_mjml modern
```
